### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nicolas !

I'm currently working as a Senior Backend Engineer at OpenClassrooms.

:spiral_calendar: I've worked on differents kinds of projects and I've got the opportunity to use differents frameworks / tools / languages depending on the context :coffee: :
- e-commerce extensions (Prestashop, Magento, Magento2)
- e-commerce plateform (Magento / Magento2)
- Containerize application (Akeneo) and deploy it on OpenShift
- MicroServices / AWS / serverless / TypeScript
- Laravel on personal projects
- Symfony / Clean Architecture in my current position

Hobbies : 
- I'm riding MTB 2 or 3 times a week :mountain_biking_man:, I like to be in the forest and push my limits physically and technically
- I'm also playing electric guitar :guitar: (:metal:)
- I like skiing :ski:
